### The new way to use every last meal.

#### By Derick Yang

**swipe** is a tool that every college student needs at the end of the semester: 

*'It's finals season, and I need to eat. I don't want to pay full price for dining hall meals...'*

*'What should I do with all these meal swipes I've got left???'*

Using a MEAN stack (Angular, Node, Mongo), this site is designed to solve the problems that students face every day towards the end of a semester.
